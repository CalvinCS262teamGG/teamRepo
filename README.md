# LifeManager

We propose an app that allows a user to see how they spend their time throughout an average day. The user interface will allow the user to easily record what they are doing with the tap of a button. They will be able to go and check how they normally spend their time on any given day as well as see what they do the most during the day. Because students are often incredibly busy this will allow them to see what wastes their time. Giving them the opportunity to optimize their average day. We found an app called Smarter Time in the google play store that seems to be similar to the ideas we have. We will try to attempt something like this idea but we will spend most of our time on the analytics side.

Recording this data will be relatively simple, each task can have an array of start and stop times which will be determined by the user input. We plan to provide fairly detailed analytics to the user. For example, total time spent per day/week/month/year, what time of day one usually starts on a certain action, what an average day of the week looks like (this would be specific to each day of the week). We estimate that the majority of our time will be spent on the analytics and user interface, and that relatively little time will be spent on the data base.
