## Vision Statement:

LifeManager is an app that enables its user to keep track of daily activities and review their day through the tracking of time. In addition to the basic time tracking feature, LifeManager will also enable its user the chance to set goals and time limits for desired activities. Imagine a world of college students easily tracking, reviewing and adjusting their time to effectively live a more balanced life.All of this, simply possible with a push of a button!

What makes LifeManager different is the simplicity of it. We aim to make it quick to use and easy to read and understand how your time is spent. Our app will remove complex number displays and unnecessary button pushing to program certain specific wants.

As an example, you will be able to see, total time spent per day/week/month/year, what time of day one usually starts on a certain action and what an average day of the week looks like (this would be specific to each day of the week). Help make your life a little more manageable with LifeManager
